* Disclaimer * Author acknowledged she would define abbreviations, add comments, 
and fill in the README.md.  She also walked me through the code after these comments
and it all made perfect sense.  These comments were from trying to get through it
without guidance

Purpose
Is the purpose of the project is clear?

# The readme.md file hasn't been completed yet. I'm not really able to determine 
# what the project is about without it. Although from the project pitch, I know 
# this study is determining which US religions are most similar in their geographic
# distribution.

Is it clear what each file in the project is intended for?

# Not without some investigation.  Perhaps some pseudo code describing what each
# file is and what role it plays in your analysis would be helpful.

It is clear how the various files interact?

# It's difficult to tell.  There are a couple key abbreviations that I don't know 
# the meaning of.   The code is succinct and clear so given enough time, I'm sure 
# I could determine how the files are interacting, but it's not immediately obvious.

Is it clear what the purpose if of specific sections of code?

# Sections of clode are clearly separated into individual steps - well done.
# However, the same issue of not knowing the meaning of "ADH" "CNG" or "RATE sims"
# cropped up.

How well commented is the code on a scale of 1(no comments) to 10(very well commented).

# 3

How can the purposes of the project and files be improved?

# As I said previously, pseudo code guiding the user through what each line accomplishes
# and the relevance of new files would be helpful.  Also, the README.md being 
# completed will help.

Organization
Is the project organized such that you can intuit where the data, scripts, and output files are stored?

# Yes, there are only two .csv files used and they're properly saved in the 
# Data folder.  Directory organization looks good from the "Project" folder down.

Approximately how much time did it take you to understand the work flow in the project?

# Without guidance, it would have taken awhile, but with a quick 30 second run-down
# it made a lot of sense.

How well defined are code chunks in the project?

# Very well defined - didn't use a markdown file so no {r} chunks, but the separate
# tasks are labeled with text and separated by spaces.

How can organization be improved?

# The organization is solid - comments will help (sorry for redundancy)

Functionality
Does the code appear to advance the purpose of the project?

# Yes, she produced a function that allows you to input any given religion and 
# determine the most similar religions, geographically speaking.

Do the existing components of the project appear to function?

# All the lines run correctly with the exception of line 18.  Cannot determine why 
# it won't run because the syntax is exactly the same as some other lines that perform
# similar functions.  For some reason, the error associated with line 18 doesn't 
# screw up the rest of the code following it.

How can the author improve functionality of code?

# Will have to determine the cause of the error in line 18 and that's the only
# real functionality issue.


Other Comments

# Great job! Your code is organized and fluid. With the comments added in and fixing
# that weird snag in line 18, this will be a great project!
